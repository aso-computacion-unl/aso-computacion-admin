# ASO Computación — Admin

Content admin for the ASO Computación student association. It manages the content (events and photos, FAQ, board, pillars, socials) that the static landing consumes at build time.

## Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19, TypeScript
- Hexagonal layers: `src/domain`, `src/application`, `src/infrastructure`, `src/interface` (boundaries enforced by `architecture-boundaries.test.ts`)
- Prisma 6 + PostgreSQL
- Cloudinary for images (SDK confined to `src/infrastructure/storage`)
- Vitest 3 for unit and Prisma integration tests
- Deployed on Vercel

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm test` | Unit tests |
| `npm run test:integration` | Prisma integration tests against the disposable Docker database (`docker-compose.test.yml`) |

Requires Node `>=22.12.0` (see `.nvmrc`).

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace every `__REPLACE_*__` value.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string for development and production |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | Disposable test database used only by `npm run test:integration`; see `.env.example` for the exact required target |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Shared administrator password |
| `ADMIN_SECRET` | Secret that signs session cookies (at least 32 characters) |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Cloudinary cloud name |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | Cloudinary API key |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Cloudinary API secret (server-side only) |
| `CLOUDINARY_FOLDER` | Optional base folder for uploads; defaults to `aso-computacion`. Each feature uploads into its own subfolder (e.g. `aso-computacion/events`) |

## Image uploads

Uploads accept JPEG, PNG and WebP up to 5 MB. The minimum width is chosen by each caller (event photos 1200 px; board photos a smaller value). Cloudinary reports the real width after upload; an image narrower than the caller's minimum is destroyed immediately and rejected with `IMAGE_TOO_SMALL`. Images are otherwise retained: replacing a photo never deletes the previous asset.
